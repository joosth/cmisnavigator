CMIS Navigator
==============
A Python/GTK based desktop client for CMIS repositories

WARNING
=======
This code has not been extensively tested (yet). We welcome any feedback and help.

Installing and configuring
==========================
unpack the tarball in /opt or copy the contents from the github src folder to /opt/navigator
edit /opt/navigator/navigator.cfg, or create a copy in ~/.navigator.cfg

By default navigator.cfg points to a folder in Alfresco's CMIS test repository.

Run /opt/navigator/navigator


Windows
=======
CMIS Navigator is written in Python using PyGTK (it uses GTK).
You can run it on Windows if you have the appropriate libraries installed.
There is a problem with drag and drop under Windows, please see the issue tracker on GitHub (https://github.com/joosth/cmisnavigator)
I am not a Windows user, and I have very little experience using Python/GTK on Windows. Any help to make CMIS Navigator run under Windows is welcome.
